# MovieReview_ReactNative
This movie review app is the first React Native mobile app project I built in 2021

The purpose of this small project was to discover React Native as well as API calls to develop mobile apps.
Also, I've ever wanted to know how mobile apps were built, from the code to our phone.

This mobile app is simple.
I put a text input field on the top of the screen with a search button below it.

Once the user entered the title of a movie and pressed the search button, the app calls the "The Movie DataBase" API to get all the responses related to this specific movie.

For example, if I look for Avatar, this is the response ov the Avatar query :

As you can see, the API feedback gives us :
- Picture of the movie
- Details about each film rendered
- The release date
- A public note from 0 to 10

This is the result for Avatar movie and here is the result for the famous movie Titanic :

By scrolling on this window, you can find review for a lot of films linked to the movie the user is looking for.

I ended the project here without navigating to another window with the details of each movie when pressing one of them.
I could have done more but I wanted to build my own social media mobile app in React Native that I hope you'll be checking :)
